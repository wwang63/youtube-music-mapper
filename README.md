## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A YouTube Music account with liked songs

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/willwangfr/youtube-music-mapper.git
   cd youtube-music-mapper
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install ytmusicapi flask requests
   ```

## Getting Your Data

### Option A: Google Takeout (Easier)

No API setup needed - just export your data from Google:

1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com)
2. Click "Deselect all", then select only **"YouTube and YouTube Music"**
3. Click "All YouTube data included" and select:
   - **playlists** (includes your Liked Music)
   - **history** (your listening history)
4. Click "Next step" → "Create export"
5. Download and extract the ZIP file
6. Run the import:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python import_takeout.py /path/to/Takeout
   ```

### Option B: YouTube Music API (More Data)

This method gets more metadata (album art, related artists) but requires auth setup:

1. **Authenticate with YouTube Music**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ytmusicapi browser
   ```
   Follow the instructions to paste your request headers from YouTube Music.

2. **Fetch your data**
   ```bash
   python ytmusic_client.py
   ```

3. **Fetch song metadata (years and view counts)** *(optional)*
   ```bash
   python fetch_song_metadata.py
   ```
   Note: Makes API calls for each song, takes a few minutes for large libraries.

## Building the Graph

After importing your data (via either method):

```bash
cd backend
python assign_genres.py
python rebuild_graph.py
```

This creates `frontend/graph_data.json`.

## Running the App

1. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python server.py
   ```
   Server runs on http://localhost:5050

2. **Open the frontend**

   Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser, or serve it:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then visit http://localhost:8000

## Usage

### Navigation
- **Pan**: Click and drag the background
- **Zoom**: Scroll wheel
- **Select Artist**: Click on a node to open the artist panel
- **Search**: Type in the search box to find artists or songs

### Controls
- **Node Size**: Adjust the size of artist nodes
- **Link Strength**: Adjust how tightly connected artists cluster
- **Show Related Artists**: Toggle visibility of artists not in your library
- **Show Labels**: Toggle artist name labels
- **Show Genres**: Toggle genre-based coloring

### DJ Tools
1. **Mix Path Finder**: Enter two artists to find a transition path between them
2. **Bridge Artists**: Click to find artists that connect different genres
3. **Set Builder**: Select a starting genre and flow type (Energy Up, Wind Down, or Genre Journey)
4. **Your Set**: Click songs to add them to your set, then export

### Export Options

## Refreshing Your Data

To update with new liked songs:
```bash
cd backend
python ytmusic_client.py
python assign_genres.py
python fetch_song_metadata.py
python rebuild_graph.py
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Authentication failed" error**
- Re-run `ytmusicapi browser` to refresh your credentials

**Songs missing year/views**
- Re-run `fetch_song_metadata.py` - some API calls may have failed

**"Other" genre too high**
- Edit `assign_genres.py` to add more artists to the `ARTIST_GENRES` dictionary
